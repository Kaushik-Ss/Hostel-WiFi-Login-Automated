## How to use
- Clone / download repo 
- Run the latest file **(main_v3.py)** other files are for documentation purpose 
- $ Run pip install selinium in cmd 
- Open main_v3.py in IDLE or referred IDE and proceed to **line 103 and pass username and password as arguments to connect function** (here replace it with rollno and pwd where in case mine is '20I224' and '20I224', **Note pass the username and password as string**
- $ Cd to the cloned location and do $python main_v3.py

This can still be automated with While True, sleep and occassional pinging to check connection establishment, try except blocks for better debugging, I haven't implemented this as this was done to showcase rapid prototyping.
